Relationships between Classes
School and Students:

A School can have many Student objects. Students are managed by the school through enrollment processes.
School and Teachers:

A School employs many Teacher objects. The school manages teachers, and teachers are assigned to classes.
School and Classes:

The School has a collection of Class objects, each representing a particular section or grade level. Students are assigned to these classes, and each class is taught by a teacher.
Student and Classes:

A Student can be enrolled in many Class objects. Each class represents a particular grade level, and students may belong to different classes for different subjects.
Class and Teacher:

Each Class has one assigned Teacher, who is responsible for managing the students in that class. Teachers may be assigned to multiple classes.
Teacher and Subjects:

A Teacher can teach multiple Subject objects. Each teacher has a list of subjects they specialize in, and these subjects are linked to classes they are assigned to teach.
Student and Subjects:

A Student can enroll in different Subject objects through their respective classes. Each subject might have a different teacher, and the student can receive grades for the subjects they are studying.
Summary of Relationships:
One-to-Many: A School has many students, teachers, classes, and subjects.
Many-to-Many: Students and classes have a many-to-many relationship, as students can be in many classes, and classes can have many students.
One-to-One/Many: Each class has one teacher, but a teacher can be assigned to multiple classes.
By organizing the system using these classes, it becomes easier to manage and track the operations of the school, such as assigning teachers to classes, enrolling students, and tracking their academic performance.
